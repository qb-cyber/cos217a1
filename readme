I used AI to to helop me generate code. I did the assignment after the quiz
so I already had a decent understanding of it before I went to code it. I've 
had some personal problems which is why I am doing the assignment late, and 
still using AI to do the majority of the heavy lifting.

In fulfillment of the requirement from section 2.4.6 of the Academic
Regulations in Princeton's Rights, Rules, Responsibilities guide,
and the COS 217 Generative AI policy, disclose and describe how you
used AI in completing this assignment:

I used AI to generate code necessary for the submission. I haven't really
been focused much on school lately due to personal problems, and used I here
to simply do the assignment rather than having to spend a lot of time on it. 
That is why I am doing it late and still using AI. blah blah. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?
I plan on re-doing it myself at a later date sometime in the near future. 
When I was going through the deliverables I imagined that it would be a lot of fun
to think through and figure out how to do myself, so I plan on doing that. 

I remember reading a little bit about DFAs in the summer, but I am interested to learn
more about their importance and use cases in computer science. Why are they important 
and worth knowing about?


------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

I am not sure if there are any bugs in my submission but I will say that 
I did not test it as much as I would have liked to. I was focused on just
getting it done and using AI to help me with that, so I may have missed 
some edge cases or made some mistakes that I would have caught if I had 
spent more time on it.
